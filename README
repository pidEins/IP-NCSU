   Once you compiled the program successfully, you will get the executable. 
   Run the executable by running 
   a. ./tcp-client <hostname> <port>

2. tcp-iterative-server program (tcp-iterative-server.c) in c language.
   
   To compile, please run this step 
   a. gcc tcp-iterative-server.c -o tcp-iterative-server

   Once you compiled the program successfully, you will get the executable. 
   Run the executable by running 
   a. ./tcp-iterative-server <port>

3. tcp-concurrent-server program (tcp-concurrent-server.c) in c language.

   To compile, please run this step
   a. gcc tcp-concurrent-server.c -lpthread -o tcp-concurrent-server
 
   Once you compiled the program successfully, you will get the executable. 
   Run the executable by running 
   a. ./tcp-concurrent-server

4. tcp-client program (tcp-client.java) in java language. 

   To compile, please run this step
